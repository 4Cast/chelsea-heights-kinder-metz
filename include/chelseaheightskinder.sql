Children are encouraged to make independent choices and individual needs are supported and catered for.</p>\n<p>Our program offers the children numerous music, art, literacy, language, maths and Science activities, presented in a fun and engaging manner. Several incursions and excursions are planned each year to develop and extend learning interests. We are committed to strengthening each childâ€™s self-esteem and confidence: we encourage their ability to develop and share their ideas and knowledge.</p>\n<p>We promote respect for others through small group and partnered experiences, working as part of a team and through the sharing and taking turns of equipment and resources.</p>\n<p>Children attending our kindergarten are part of an inclusive environment that offers equal opportunity for all and provides a program that reflects and values diversity. Our philosophy recognises and follows the learning outcomes of the National Quality Framework (NQF) and the Victorian Early Years Learning Framework (VEYLF).
